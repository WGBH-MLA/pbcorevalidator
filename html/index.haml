      Hello, this is an extremely preliminary PBCore validator. It can detect certain types of errors and deviations from "best practices" in "PBCore":http://www.pbcore.org/ records.

      Note that this tool is *not* officially endorsed by anyone affiliated with PBCore.

      For more information, see "the blog post introducting the validator":http://vermicel.li/.

    %h2 Validate a document
    %form{ :action => "/validator", :method => "post", :enctype => "multipart/form-data" }
      %p
        %label{ :for => "file" } Select a file to validate:
        %input{ :id => "file", :name => "file", :type => "file" }
      %p
        %label{ :for => "textarea" }<
          %strong> or
          &nbsp;paste a PBCore document into the textbox:
        %br
